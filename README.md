# TDDD27_2023_MealPlanning

## Functional

We have created a web application that helps the user to plan meals and search for recipes in a public database. The application has different pages, a profile where it will be possible for the user to see liked recipes. A calendar, where liked recipes can be added to a calendar for easy planning of what to eat and when. A friends page where the user can search on other users and see their liked recipes.
The application is made with the goal to facilitate meal planning.


## Technical


The client-side of the application has been made in React with different components added together.
The server-side connected to the recipe database is made in express.js. While the database and the rest of the backend is made using Firebase.


We have used [Edmam](https://developer.edamam.com/edamam-recipe-api) for our Recipe search.
